                         <p>Scientists and Practitioners now agree the brain can undergo significant and permanent changes. This is commonly referred to as neuroplasticity
                        Using this principle DR Alfred Tomatis developed what is now called the Tomatis® listening therapy
                        <br><br> •	This therapy delivers music, via wireless headphones, through the ear and through bone conduction. The music  is filtered and gated. 

                         <br><br>•	It produces sounds that change unexpectedly. 

                        <br><br> •	This music “wakes up” the brain and encourages neuron growth.

                        <br><br> •	This music also exercises the muscles of the ear which transmit the signals to the brain. 

                         <br><br>•	The pathways become stronger and help cause a permanent change.

                        <br> <br> What does Tomatis® Look Like?
                         <br> Participants would wear wireless headphones, with the music coming through them, for ideally 2 hours a day for 13 days consecutively. 
                         <br>There are 2 further intensives to follow one usually at about 4 weeks after the first and the third about 8 weeks following the second. 
                         <br>Times and dates can be flexible depending on the child and the individual results.
                        <br> Participants can hear while they are wearing the earphones and can participate in class if that is what is required.
                        <br> <br> Research and testimonials and suggested reading

                        <br> <br>There are many links to studies, research and information from these websites.
                          <br> <br>“The Brains way of healing” by Norman Doidge (esp. chapter 8.) 
                        <br> <br> It is a great idea to attend a free webinar hosted by Maria Moell Lundqvist.  These webinars are very informative and are usually held every 2nd Tuesday and the dates are on the NZ tomatis®website.
