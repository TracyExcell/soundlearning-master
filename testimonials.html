                       <p><br><br>The only South
                        Island-based certified
                        practitioner of a special
                        music therapy is aiming
                        to help Southland
                        children and adults
                        improve their learning,
                        language and social
                        skills.

                       <br><br> Te Anau early childhood
                        educator Pam Mitchell trained
                        in the Tomatis Method last year
                        because she wanted to help a
                        friend’s child who was struggling to
                        learn.
                        <br>“I discovered Tomatis when
                        I was investigating ways to help
                        a friend’s son who had various
                        undiagnosed issues that were
                        hampering his learning. I was
                        amazed by the results.”
                       <br> In a therapy session, patients
                        listen to songs by Mozart and
                        Gregorian chants that are
                        intentionally altered so the listener's
                        brain is unable to anticipate sudden
                        changes in tonal contrasts. The
                        result, according to the method,
                        is that the brain is 'surprised', thus
                        encouraging it to ‘wake up’ and
                        stimulate the ear and the brain.
                        The Tomatis Method is designed
                        to aid those with learning and
                        language disorders, attention
                        disorders, emotional disorders and
                        motor disorders. It stresses that it is
                        an educational programme, not a
                        medical treatment nor a means to
                        establish a medical diagnosis.
                        <br><br>The Rotary Club of Fiordland has
                        funded therapy sessions for fiveyear-
                        old Oliver Salter, who has a
                        severe developmental delay caused
                        by a rare partial chromosome
                        deletion. Oliver's mother Rachel
                        Walker said she thought that there
                        was nothing to lose but potentially
                        a lot to gain when she first heard
                        about the therapy.
                       <br><br> “We noticed a change with
                        Oliver’s speech in the first couple
                        of days, he started making new
                        sounds. His behaviour when he is
                        in a social setting has changed a
                        lot, he is communicating more and
                        has a better understanding of his
                        environment,” she said.
                        <br>Seeing how much the therapy
                        helped Oliver was the catalyst for
                        Mrs Mitchell to resign from her role
                        as an adviser and co-ordinator for
                        home-based childcare company
                        Busy Bodies and become a fulltime
                        practitioner of the method.
                        She could work with people in
                        Southland and Otago and was
                        looking to set up a programme in a
                        school.
                       <br> Mrs Mitchell said although the
                        therapy had been proven to help
                        children and adults with special
                        needs, it could help anyone of any
                        age improve their concentration,
                        speech and listening skills.
                        “It can help adults and children
                        who have trouble concentrating,
                        who suffer from anxiety, who
                        worry a lot and have co-ordination
                        issues,” she said.
                       <br>Mrs Mitchell said a standard
                        session consisted of listening to
                        this music via wireless headphones
                        for two hours a day for 13 days in a
                        row. A standard package included
                        three lots of these 13-day sessions
                        with a month's break between
                        each. Mrs Mitchell said she was
                        planning on receiving additional
                        training on how to cater time
                        frames to meet different needs.
                       <br>The Tomatis listening therapy,
                        which has been available in New
                        Zealand for two years, is used
                        around the globe, including in 200
                           schools in Europe.</p>

           <p>30 September 2016<br>
                   <br> To Whom it may concern, 

                    <br>We had the pleasure of having Pam Mitchell enter our family’s life in 2013, when we were looking for childcare for our two children, William and Jessie. At the time Pam was the visiting teacher for home based childcarers Busy Bodies in Te Anau.<br>

                    Our son William at the time was 3 and diagnosed with a severe communication disorder and possible ADHD. He required special supervision and had multiple extra services visit him, such as an occupational therapist, speech therapist and early intervention coordinator, while all under the care of a pediatrician. With the help of these services, his home educator Becky, and the guidance of Pam, William started to make some progress.<br>

                    <br>During 2015, doctors felt that William was exhibiting more markers of ASD (Autism) than previous tests had shown. As William started school in June,  Pam approached my husband, Kris, and I about a new therapy that she had researched and trained in. This was Tomatis, a music therapy that was geared to awakening the brain and making new cognitive connections. I considered this alternative medicine, until I spoke with our GP and she said music therapy and physical therapy were some of the only medically proven therapies, that didn’t involve drugs, that helped children on the spectrum.<br> 

                    <br>William began the Tomatis programme during his second term at school. I didn’t think we would make it through one session as William didn’t like things on his head, around his ears or loud music, these things could throw him into a meltdown. I was amazed one day when i arrived to pick him up that he was sound asleep. Within days William had stopped bed wetting, previous visits to an incontinence nurse hadn’t stopped this. He was now sleeping through the night regularly, for the first time in 5 years. He was generally calmer and had longer periods of focus. William’s speech therapist was astounded by the huge advancement in his oral language in the month between visits. After our second round of Tomatis, she felt his oral language skills were now on par with his peers.
                    After round two, changes weren’t as dramatic, but William was focusing in class better, but still achieving “below’ the national standard. Three months later after our 3rd round of Tomatis, William was now achieving “at” the national standard.<br>

                    <br>As a trained teacher, I have seen the struggles that many children have with school. The fact that William was now achieving, meant he could further concentrate on developing his social skills and continue to be a happy soul.<br>

                   <br> Our main goal for William has always been to be raise someone who can be happy in themselves while also positively contributing to society. Tomatis has been one of the non-invasive things that has allowed us to set along this path. The care, patience and passion for this therapy and her clients that Pam gives is another serious contributing factor.<br>

                    <br>I highly recommend this therapy and Pam Mitchell,  to all ASD parents, as we all know there isn’t anything to lose from our children listening to beautiful, peaceful music everyday. You will be amazed at the positive changes it will make to your whole family.<br>
