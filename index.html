                         <p>I trained as a Kindergarten Teacher in 1976 and have since then worked in most areas of Early Childhood Education including special needs, with some time also spent as an occupational therapy aid.

                         <br><br>I am very passionate about the importance of fostering learning in young children and their right to be respected and listened to so they gain the self esteem and confidence to become happy, well adjusted young adults.

                         I am also a great follower of Nathan Maikere-Wallace. I have attended several of his workshops and studied much of the literature he has recommended regarding the development of the brain.

                        <br><br> It was through researching special needs that I discovered the Tomatis® Method and after training as a Tomatis® Practitioner Level 1 I am very excited to be able to offer the Tomatis® Method in person to the Southland area especially.
                         <br><br> After treating clients over the past year and seeing the results that have been achieved I have resigned from my position as a Co-ordinator for Homebased care to dedicate the time I think this non-invasive therapy deserves.
